# TinyExplorer

Introducing TinyExplore, the compact and efficient solution for managing your files and folders with enhanced privacy and security features. Gone are the days of relying on external resources â€“ I've stripped down the code to its core, making it truly lightweight and perfect for deployment in environments without internet access or outbound connections.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.4 or higher.
- Fileinfo, iconv, zip, tar and mbstring extensions are strongly recommended.

> There are still many things to do, but we continue to develop
